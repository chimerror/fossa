Fossa
=====

Introduction
------------

I've long wanted to make small games on the side, and I really love Clojure, so I'm making a game I've
codenamed fossa for the [August 2016 Lisp Game Jam on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/august-2016-lisp-game-jam). The start date is 2016-08-01, and the due date is 2016-08-11. I have a title in mind, but I like using a codename first.

I'm intending to do everything, coding, design, art, and music.

Inspiration
-----------

The basic idea for this game builds off a riddle I saw on TED-Ed they called
[The Temple Riddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSbvlktToSY).

You are on an expedition to explore a temple. You've gotten what you came for and are making your way
back when a trap triggers, beginning to fill the temple with poison gas. You'll die in an hour if you
don't get out. There are four different ways to go, but you can't remember which one is the exit. It
takes twenty minutes to explore each way and twenty minutes to make it back. You do have eight more
people in your party, so you could split up, explore, and then reconvene, but there's a problem...

Two of your party members have been possessed by the spirits of the King and Queen entombed in the
temple. They will not harm you or your party members directly, but they have no compunctions against
lying to you about how to get out, and will do so (It's more sadistic that way...). They don't _have_
to lie, they just can, and _will_ if you ask them which path is correct. These facts mean you can't
really quiz your party members right now to find the possessed ones, you'll have to figure it out
through logic. You do know that _you_ are not possessed. Can you find a way to figure out the right way
to go?

The answer is in the video.

My Spin
-------

I've decided to change the flavor and iterate through this riddle a few times to make a longer game of
it. Basically, this will be a type of logic game where you need to determine which members of your
party are liars so you can escape the temple (well, cross-universe anomaly in my flavor). I may also
expand the game by having certain party members having certain tools or abilities that are necessary to
explore successfully (like a flashlight, or something).

I'm writing this in [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) using
[phzr](https://github.com/dparis/phzr), which are ClojureScript bindings for the
[Phaser](http://phaser.io) JavaScript Library. I am using [brute](https://github.com/markmandel/brute),
an entity-component system library for dependency management purposes.

Most of my updates are at the
[game jam community page](https://itch.io/jam/august-2016-lisp-game-jam/community) on itch.io. I'll
also probably make a few comments on my twitters
([@foobardog (mundane account)](https://twitter.com/foobardog) and
[@chimerror (furry account, may be NSFW)](https://twitter.com/chimerror)).

I'm keeping track of tasks and things on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vYFW4RqW). When I get
to some interesting gameplay coding, I may do some streaming on my
[Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/foobardog).
